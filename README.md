# LALang
--------
This repository is made for the first 5 tasks of the discipline of compiler
construction that occured during the first semester of 2022 at UFSCar
(Universidade Federal de São Carlos) with professor Daniel Lucrédio.

## Objective
Create a lexer for the language LA that is made by the professors
Jander Moreira, Helena de Medeiros Caseli and Daniel Lucrédio, for the
discipline of Algorithm Construction and Programming.

## Dependencies
To build the project I found that old versions of antlr do not tranpile
correctly for the current go antlr runtime, so I sugest using the most recently
version of each dependency.
- GO (>= 1.18)
- Antlr4 (>= 4.10.1)
